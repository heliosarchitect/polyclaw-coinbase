## Features

### Market browsing
- `polyclaw markets trending` — Top markets by 24h volume
- `polyclaw markets search "query"` — Search markets by keyword
- `polyclaw market <id>` — Market details with prices

### Trading
- `polyclaw buy <market_id> YES <amount>` — Buy YES position
- `polyclaw buy <market_id> NO <amount>` — Buy NO position
- Split + CLOB execution (split USDC → YES+NO, sell unwanted side)

### Position tracking
- `polyclaw positions` — List open positions with live P&L
- `polyclaw position <id>` — Detailed position view
- Positions tracked locally in `~/.openclaw/polyclaw/positions.json`

### Wallet management
- `polyclaw wallet status` — Show address, POL/USDC.e balances
- `polyclaw wallet approve` — Set Polymarket contract approvals (one-time)

### Hedge discovery
- `polyclaw hedge scan` — Scan trending markets for hedging opportunities
- `polyclaw hedge scan --query "topic"` — Scan markets matching a query
- `polyclaw hedge analyze <id1> <id2>` — Analyze specific market pair

Uses LLM-powered contrapositive logic to find covering portfolios. Only logically necessary implications are accepted — correlations and "likely" relationships are rejected.

**Coverage tiers:** T1 (≥95%), T2 (90-95%), T3 (85-90%)

## Quick start

### 1. Install skill

**Option A: Install from ClawHub (recommended)**

```bash
clawhub install polyclaw
cd ~/.openclaw/skills/polyclaw
uv sync
```

**Option B: Manual install**

```bash
cp -r polyclaw ~/.openclaw/skills/
cd ~/.openclaw/skills/polyclaw
uv sync
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Add the following to your `openclaw.json` under `skills.entries.polyclaw.env`:

```json
"polyclaw": {
  "enabled": true,
  "env": {
    "CHAINSTACK_NODE": "https://polygon-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_KEY",
    "POLYCLAW_PRIVATE_KEY": "0x...",
    "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "sk-or-v1-..."
  }
}
```

**Where to get the keys:**
- **Chainstack node** — [Sign up at Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com) (free tier available, sign up with GitHub, X, or Google)
- **OpenRouter API key** — [Create key at OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)

**Security warning:** Keep only small amounts in this wallet. Withdraw regularly to a secure wallet.

> **Looking for standalone CLI usage?** This skill is designed for OpenClaw. For standalone CLI usage without OpenClaw, see [polymarket-alpha-bot](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/polymarket-alpha-bot).

### 3. First-time setup (required for trading)

Before your first trade, set Polymarket contract approvals (one-time, costs ~0.01 POL in gas):

```bash
uv run python scripts/polyclaw.py wallet approve
```

This submits 6 approval transactions to Polygon. You only need to do this once per wallet.

### 4. Run commands

```bash
# Browse markets
uv run python scripts/polyclaw.py markets trending
uv run python scripts/polyclaw.py markets search "election"

# Find hedging opportunities
uv run python scripts/polyclaw.py hedge scan --limit 10

# Check wallet and trade
uv run python scripts/polyclaw.py wallet status
uv run python scripts/polyclaw.py buy <market_id> YES 50
```

## Example prompts

Natural language prompts you can use with OpenClaw:

### 1. Browse trending markets
```
What's trending on Polymarket?
```
Returns market IDs, questions, prices, and volume.

### 2. Get market details
```
Show me details for market <market_id>
```
Use the market ID from Polymarket URL or from the trending markets response above.

Returns full market info with link to Polymarket.

### 3. Check wallet status
```
What's my PolyClaw wallet balance?
```
Shows address, POL balance (for gas), and USDC.e balance.

### 4. Direct trading
If you have your own conviction on a market:
```
Buy $50 YES on market <market_id>
```
Executes split + CLOB flow and records position.

### 5. Hedge discovery flow
Find LLM-analyzed arbitrage opportunities:
```
Find me some hedging opportunities on Polymarket
```
or more specifically:
```
Run hedge scan limit 10
```
> **Note:** This takes a few minutes. The skill fetches open markets and sends pairs to the LLM for logical implication analysis.

Review the results — you'll see coverage tiers (T1 = 95%+, T2 = 90-95%, T3 = 85-90%) and the market pairs where you can take hedged positions.

### 6. Check positions
```
Show my PolyClaw positions
```
Lists open positions with entry price, current price, and P&L.

### 7. Sell early
To exit a position before the market resolves:
```
Sell my YES position on market <market_id>
```
Sells your tokens on the CLOB order book at current market price.

### Full flow example

1. **"What's trending on Polymarket?"** → Get market IDs
2. **"Run hedge scan limit 10"** → Wait for LLM analysis
3. Review hedge opportunities with coverage tiers
4. **"Buy $25 YES on market abc123"** → Take position on target market
5. **"Buy $25 NO on market xyz789"** → Take position on covering market
6. **"Show my PolyClaw positions"** → Verify entries and track P&L

## Trading flow

1. **Set approvals** (one-time): `polyclaw wallet approve`
2. **Execute trade**: `polyclaw buy <market_id> YES 50`
   - Split $50 USDC.e → 50 YES + 50 NO tokens
   - Sell 50 NO tokens via CLOB → recover ~$15 (at 30¢)
   - Result: 50 YES tokens, net cost ~$35
3. **Track position**: `polyclaw positions`

### Understanding the split mechanism

Polymarket uses a **Conditional Token Framework (CTF)**. You can't directly "buy YES tokens" — instead:

1. **Split**: Deposit USDC.e into the CTF contract, which mints equal amounts of YES + NO tokens
2. **Sell unwanted**: Sell the side you don't want via the CLOB order book
3. **Result**: You hold your desired position, having recovered partial cost from selling the other side

**Example** (buying YES at $0.65):
```
Split:  $2 USDC.e → 2 YES + 2 NO tokens
Sell:   2 NO tokens @ $0.35 → recover ~$0.70
Net:    Paid ~$1.30 for 2 YES tokens (effective price: $0.65)
```

### CLOB order IDs

When you execute a trade, the CLOB sell returns an **order ID** like:
```
0xc93d6214515b2436feb684854c98d314ad19111d7ab822a9c885d61588d5beaa
```

This is **not a blockchain transaction hash** — it's an off-chain Polymarket order book identifier. CLOB orders are matched off-chain and settled in batches on-chain.

**What you can do with the order ID:**

Query order details via the CLOB API (requires wallet authentication):
```python
from py_clob_client.client import ClobClient

client = ClobClient("https://clob.polymarket.com", key=private_key, chain_id=137)
creds = client.create_or_derive_api_creds()
client.set_api_creds(creds)

order = client.get_order("0xc93d6214...")
# Returns: id, market, side, price, size_matched, status, created_at, etc.
```

**API endpoint:** `GET https://clob.polymarket.com/data/order/<order_hash>`

**Response fields:** `id`, `market`, `asset_id`, `side`, `price`, `original_size`, `size_matched`, `status` (MATCHED/LIVE/CANCELLED), `type` (FOK/GTC), `created_at`, `maker_address`, `associate_trades`

**Note:** There's no public explorer for CLOB order IDs. To view your trade history, connect your wallet at polymarket.com → Portfolio → Activity.

## Hedge discovery flow

1. **Scan markets**: `polyclaw hedge scan --query "election"`
2. **Review output**: Table shows Tier, Coverage, Cost, Target, Cover
3. **Analyze pair**: `polyclaw hedge analyze <id1> <id2>`
4. **Execute if profitable**: Buy both positions manually

**Coverage tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (HIGH):** ≥95% coverage — near-arbitrage
- **Tier 2 (GOOD):** 90-95% — strong hedges
- **Tier 3 (MODERATE):** 85-90% — decent but noticeable risk
- **Tier 4 (LOW):** <85% — speculative (filtered by default)

## Polymarket contracts (Polygon mainnet)

| Contract | Address |
|----------|---------|
| USDC.e | `0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174` |
| CTF | `0x4D97DCd97eC945f40cF65F87097ACe5EA0476045` |
| CTF Exchange | `0x4bFb41d5B3570DeFd03C39a9A4D8dE6Bd8B8982E` |
| Neg Risk CTF Exchange | `0xC5d563A36AE78145C45a50134d48A1215220f80a` |
| Neg Risk Adapter | `0xd91E80cF2E7be2e162c6513ceD06f1dD0dA35296` |

## Troubleshooting

### "No wallet available"
Set the `POLYCLAW_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable:
```bash
export POLYCLAW_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
```

### "CHAINSTACK_NODE not set"
Set the Polygon RPC URL:
```bash
export CHAINSTACK_NODE="https://polygon-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/YOUR_KEY"
```

### "OPENROUTER_API_KEY not set"
Required for hedge commands. Get a free key at https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys:
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..."
```

### Hedge scan finds 0 results or spurious results
Model quality matters. The default `nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free` works well. If using a different model:
- Some models find spurious correlations (false positives)
- Some models return empty responses (DeepSeek R1 uses `reasoning_content`)
- Try `--model nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free` explicitly

### "Insufficient USDC.e"
Check balance — you need USDC.e (bridged USDC) on Polygon:
```bash
uv run python scripts/polyclaw.py wallet status
```

### "CLOB order failed" / "IP blocked by Cloudflare"

Polymarket's CLOB API uses Cloudflare protection that blocks POST requests from many IPs. The solution is a **rotating residential proxy** with retry logic.

**Recommended setup (IPRoyal or similar):**
```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://user:pass@geo.iproyal.com:12321"
export CLOB_MAX_RETRIES=10
```

The CLOB client automatically retries with new IPs until finding an unblocked one. Typically succeeds within 5-10 attempts.

**Alternative options:**
1. **Sell manually** — Your split succeeded. Go to polymarket.com to sell tokens
2. **Use `--skip-sell`** — Keep both tokens: `polyclaw buy <id> YES 50 --skip-sell`

### "Approvals not set"
Run the one-time approval setup:
```bash
uv run python scripts/polyclaw.py wallet approve
```
